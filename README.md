A Java Jar library that makes easier to integrate Auth0 Authentication on MVC applications.

See the [Java Servlet Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java) to learn how to use this library in a Servlet application.

> If you are using Spring Boot 2, it is recommended to use the OIDC support available in Spring, instead of using this library. See the [Spring Boot Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java-spring-boot) for more information.

## Download

Via Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.auth0</groupId>
    <artifactId>mvc-auth-commons</artifactId>
    <version>1.8.0</version>
</dependency>
```

or Gradle:

```gradle
implementation 'com.auth0:mvc-auth-commons:1.8.0'
```


## Configuration

### Auth0 Dashboard
1. Go to the Auth0 [Applications Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and create a new Application of type **Regular Web Application**. Verify that the "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" is set to `POST`.
2. Add a valid callback URL to the "Allowed Callback URLs" field. This URL will be called with the authentication result.
3. Take the `Client Id`, `Domain`, and `Client Secret` values and use them to configure the controller.

### Java Application
4. Create a new `AuthenticationController` by using the provided Builder. Read [below](#builder-options) to learn how to change the default behavior. i.e. using the `HS256` Algorithm and Code Grant (default):
```java
AuthenticationController controller = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("domain", "client_id", "client_secret")
            .build();
```
5. Create a valid "Authorize URL" using the `AuthenticationController#buildAuthorizeUrl` method. This would normally be done on the component that shows the login page. The builder allows you to customize the parameters requested (i.e. the scope, which by default is `openid`) and then obtain the String authorize URL by calling `AuthorizeURL#build()`. **The builder is not supposed to be reused and a `IllegalStateException` will be thrown if the `build()` method is called more than once.** Redirect the user to this URL and wait for the callback on the given `redirectURL`.  

```java
//let the library generate the state/nonce parameters
String authorizeUrl = authController.buildAuthorizeUrl(request, response, "https://redirect.uri/here")
    .build();

// or use custom state/nonce parameters
String authorizeUrl = authController.buildAuthorizeUrl(request, response, "https://redirect.uri/here")
    .withState("state")
    .withNonce("nonce")
    .build();

// you can also specify custom parameters
String authorizeUrl = authController.buildAuthorizeUrl(request, response, "https://redirect.uri/here")
    .withAudience("https://myapi.me.auth0.com")
    .withScope("openid create:photos read:photos")
    .withParameter("name", "value")
    .build();
```

6. The user will be presented with the Auth0 Hosted Login page in which he'll prompt his credentials and authenticate. Your application must expect a call to the `redirectURL`. 
7. Pass the received request to the `AuthenticationController#handle` method and expect a `Tokens` instance back if everything goes well. 

> Note that this library will not store any credentials for you. It does make use of the `HttpSession` to store the state and nonce in the case that the deprecated `AuthenticationController#handle(HttpServletRequest req)` is being used.  

```java
try {
    Tokens tokens = authController.handle(request, response);
    //Use or store the tokens
    request.getSession().setAttribute("access_token", tokens.getAccessToken());
} catch (IdentityVerificationException e) {
    String code = e.getCode();
    // Something happened when trying to process the request.
    // Could be a bad request, an error from the server, 
    // or a configuration issue that triggered a failure. 
    // Check the exception code to have an idea of what went wrong.
}
```

That's it! You have authenticated the user using Auth0.

### Builder options

By default, this library will execute the [Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0-final.html) **Authorization Code Flow** and verify the ID token (if received) using the **HS256 symmetric algorithm**.

#### Signing Algorithms

The **HS256 symmetric algorithm** is the default expected signing algorithm. Tokens are signed and verified using the client secret found in your Auth0 Application's settings. You use this value when you instantiate the `AuthenticationController` instance.

If your application is using the **RS256 asymmetric algorithm**, tokens are signed using a private key and verified using the public key associated with your Auth0 domain.
If using RS256, configure a `JwkProvider` for your Auth0 domain to enable retrieving the public key needed during the verification phase: 


```java
JwkProvider jwkProvider = new JwkProviderBuilder("domain").build();
AuthenticationController authController = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("domain", "clientId", "clientSecret")
    .withJwkProvider(jwkProvider)
    .build();
```

The `JwkProvider` returned from the `JwkProviderBuilder` is cached and rate limited by default. Please see the [jwks-rsa-java repository](https://github.com/auth0/jwks-rsa-java) to learn how to customize these options.

#### OAuth Flows

The [Authorization Code Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/auth-code) is the default authorization flow.

To use the [Implicit Grant Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/implicit), configure the `AuthenticationController` with the `id_token` response type:

```java
AuthenticationController authController = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("domain", "clientId", "clientSecret")
    .withResponseType("id_token")
    .build();
```

To use the **[Hybrid Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/grant/hybrid)**, specify `id_token code` as the response type:

```java
AuthenticationController authController = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("domain", "clientId", "clientSecret")
    .withResponseType("id_token code")
    .build();
```

### Organizations

[Organizations](https://auth0.com/docs/organizations) is a set of features that provide better support for developers who build and maintain SaaS and Business-to-Business (B2B) applications.

Note that Organizations is currently only available to customers on our Enterprise and Startup subscription plans.

#### Log in to an organization

Log in to an organization by using `withOrganization()` when configuring the `AuthenticationController`:

```java
AuthenticationController controller = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("{DOMAIN}", "{CLIENT_ID}", "{CLIENT_SECRET}")
        .withOrganization("{ORG_ID}")
        .build();
```

When logging into an organization, this library will validate that the `org_id` claim of the ID Token matches the value configured.

If no organization parameter was given to the authorization endpoint, but an org_id claim is present in the ID Token, then the claim should be validated by the application to ensure that the value received is expected or known.

Normally, validating the issuer would be enough to ensure that the token was issued by Auth0, and this check is performed by this SDK.
In the case of organizations, additional checks may be required so that the organization within an Auth0 tenant is expected.

In particular, the `org_id` claim should be checked to ensure it is a value that is already known to the application.
This could be validated against a known list of organization IDs, or perhaps checked in conjunction with the current request URL (e.g., the sub-domain may hint at what organization should be used to validate the ID Token).

If the claim cannot be validated, then the application should deem the token invalid.
The following example demonstrates this, using the [java-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/java-jwt) library:
```java
// verify org_id using java-jwt, if needing to check against a list of valid organizations
Tokens tokens = authenticationController.handle(req, res);
String idToken = tokens.getIdToken();
List<String> expectedOrgIds = Arrays.asList("{ORG_ID_1"}, "{ORG_ID_2"});
DecodedJWT jwt = JWT.decode("{TOKEN}");
String jwtOrgId = jwt.getClaim("org_id").asString();
if (!expectedOrgIds.contains(jwtOrgId)) {
    // token invalid, do not trust
}
```

For more information, please read [Work with Tokens and Organizations](https://auth0.com/docs/organizations/using-tokens) on Auth0 Docs.

#### Accept user invitations

Accept a user invitation by using `withInvitation()` when configuring the `AuthenticationController` (you must also specify the organization):

```java
AuthenticationController controller = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("{DOMAIN}", "{CLIENT_ID}", "{CLIENT_SECRET}")
        .withOrganization("{ORG_ID}")
        .withInvitation("{INVITATION_ID}")
        .build();
```

The ID of the invitation and organization are available as query parameters on the invitation URL, e.g., `https://your-domain.auth0.com/login?invitation={INVITATION_ID}&organization={ORG_ID}&organization_name={ORG_NAME}`

### Troubleshooting

#### Allowing a clock skew

During ID token validation, time-based claims such as the time the token was issued at and the token's expiration time, are verified to ensure the token is valid. 
To accommodate potential small differences in system clocks, this library allows a default of **60 seconds** of clock skew.

You can customize the clock skew as shown below:     

```java
AuthenticationController authController = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("domain", "clientId", "clientSecret")
    .withClockSkew(60 * 2)   //2 minutes
    .build();
```

#### HTTP Logging 
Once you have created the instance of the `AuthenticationController` you can enable HTTP logging for all Requests and Responses to debug a specific endpoint. **This will log everything including sensitive information** so don't use it in a production environment.

```java
authController.setLoggingEnabled(true);
```
