A Java Jar library that makes easier to integrate Auth0 Authentication on MVC applications.

A few samples are available demonstrating the usage with _Java Servlets_ and _Spring_:

[Java Servlets](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java)

[Spring](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/java-spring-mvc)


## Download

Via Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.auth0</groupId>
    <artifactId>mvc-auth-commons</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

or Gradle:

```gradle
compile 'com.auth0:mvc-auth-commons:1.0.1'
```


## Configuration

### Auth0 Dashboard
1. Go to the Auth0 [Applications Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and create a new Application of type **Regular Web Application**. Verify that the "Token Endpoint Authentication Method" is set to `POST`.
2. Add a valid callback URL to the "Allowed Callback URLs" field. This URL will be called with the authentication result.
3. Take the `Client Id`, `Domain`, and `Client Secret` values and use them to configure the controller.

### Java Application
4. Create a new `AuthenticationController` by using the provided Builder. Read [below](#builder-options) to learn how to change the default behavior. i.e. using the `HS256` Algorithm and Code Grant (default):
```java
AuthenticationController controller = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("domain", "client_id", "client_secret")
            .build();
```
5. Create a valid "Authorize URL" using the `AuthenticationController#buildAuthorizeUrl` method. This would normally be done on the component that shows the login page. The builder allows you to customize the parameters requested (i.e. the scope, which by default is `openid`) and then obtain the String authorize URL by calling `AuthorizeURL#build()`. **The builder is not supposed to be reused and a `IllegalStateException` will be thrown if the `build()` method is called more than once.** Redirect the user to this URL and wait for the callback on the given `redirectURL`.  

```java
//let the library generate the state/nonce parameters
String authorizeUrl = authController.buildAuthorizeUrl(request, "https://redirect.uri/here")
    .build();

// or use custom state/nonce parameters
String authorizeUrl = authController.buildAuthorizeUrl(request, "https://redirect.uri/here")
    .withState("state")
    .withNonce("nonce")
    .build();

// you can also specify custom parameters
String authorizeUrl = authController.buildAuthorizeUrl(request, "https://redirect.uri/here")
    .withAudience("https://myapi.me.auth0.com")
    .withScope("openid create:photos read:photos")
    .withState("state")
    .withParameter("name", "value")
    .build();
```

6. The user will be presented with the Auth0 Hosted Login page in which he'll prompt his credentials and authenticate. Your application must expect a call to the `redirectURL`. 
7. Pass the received request to the `AuthenticationController#handle` method and expect a `Tokens` instance back if everything goes well. 

**Keep in mind that this library will not store any value for you, but you can use the `SessionUtils` class as a helper to store key-value data in the request's Session Storage.**

```java
try {
    Tokens tokens = authController.handle(request);
    //Use or store the tokens
    SessionUtils.set(request, "access_token", tokens.getAccessToken());
} catch (IdentityVerificationException e) {
    String code = e.getCode();
    // Something happened when trying to verify the user id
    // Check the code to have an idea of what went wrong
}
```


That's it! You have authenticated the user using Auth0.



### Builder Options
By default, the **Code Grant** flow will be preferred over other flows. This is the most secure and recommended way, read more about it [here](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/grant/authorization-code). This means that if the response type contains `code` along with other types, Code Grant will still be preferred.

You can change the authentication behavior to use **Implicit Grant** instead. To do this you'll need to check in your Applications's Settings on the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) which Algorithm is used by the Server to sign the tokens. The default algorithm is `HS256`, but it can be changed to `RS256` in the "Advanced Settings" section on the "OAuth" tab. Below you'll find some configuration examples:


#### Using Implicit Grant with HS256 algorithm

The token's are signed by the Auth0 Server using the `Client Secret`.

```java
AuthenticationController authController = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("domain", "clientId", "clientSecret")
    .withResponseType("id_token")
    .build();
```

#### Using Implicit Grant with RS256 algorithm.

The tokens are signed using the Private Key. To verify them, the **Public Key** certificate must be obtained from a trusted source like the `well-known.json` file, which can be located locally or hosted by a server. For this example, we will use the one Auth0 hosts for your application. We can obtain it using the application's domain:


```java
JwkProvider jwkProvider = new JwkProviderBuilder("domain").build();
AuthenticationController authController = AuthenticationController.newBuilder("domain", "clientId", "clientSecret")
    .withResponseType("id_token")
    .withJwkProvider(jwkProvider)
    .build();
```

The `JwkProvider` returned from the `JwkProviderBuilder` it's cached and rate limited, check it's [repository](https://github.com/auth0/jwks-rsa-java) to learn how to customize it.


### Troubleshooting

Once you have created the instance of the `AuthenticationController` you can enable HTTP logging for all Requests and Responses if you need to debug a specific endpoint. Keep in mind that this will log everything including sensitive information. Don't use it in production environment.

```java
authController.setLoggingEnabled(true);
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
